# Feron

"Feron" / "feronOS" is a hobbyist operating system (kernel as of now), written in modern C++20.  
It utilizes a freestanding runtime, boots via Multiboot2, sets up long mode, initializes a custom heap allocator, and provides VGA + serial text output.

## Features (current)
- Multiboot2 header, bootable via GRUB
- 64‑bit long mode entry
- VGA text console with automatically managed cursor
- Serial console output (`COM1`) for debugging
- Freestanding C++ runtime
- Heap initialization from the memory map provided by Multiboot
- Kernel entry point (`kmain`)

## Build & Run

### Requirements
- `clang++`, `nasm`, `ld.lld` for compiling
- `grub-mkrescue`, `xorriso` for creating the bootable ISO
- [`task`](https://taskfile.dev) for task automation

### Build the kernel
```bash
task build
```
