# feron

"Feron"/"feronOS" is a hobbyist operating system (kernel as of now), written in modern C++20.
it utilizes a freestanding runtime, boots up using Multiboot2, sets up long mode,
... initializes a custom heap allocator and provides VGA + serial text output.

## features (as of now):
- Multiboot2 header, bootable via GRUB
- 64-bit long mode entry
- VGA text console with automatically managed cursor
- serial console output (`COM1`) for debugging
- freestanding C++ runtime
- heap initialization from the memory map given by Multiboot
- kernel entry point (`kmain`)

## how to build & run:

requirements:
- `clang++`, `nasm`, `ld.ldd` for compiling
- `grub-mkrescue`, `xorisso` for making the bootable ISO
- [`task`](https://taskfile.dev) for task automation

build the kernel:
```bash
task build
```
run:
```bash
task run
```
